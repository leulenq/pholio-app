# Lessons Learned

## 2026-05-25

- When redesigning Sonner toasts, verify rendered data attributes and class attachment in `client/node_modules/sonner/dist` before styling. Sonner uses `data-sonner-theme`, not `data-theme`.
- For premium UI requests, prioritize high contrast and unmistakable brand posture first; subtle changes read as "no change" to users.
- Scope toaster styles to a namespaced host class (for example `pholio-toaster`) so styling is predictable and non-leaky.
